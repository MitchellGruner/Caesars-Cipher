# Caesars-Cipher
freeCodeCamp JavaScript exercise that takes in a string and shifts each letter by 13 places (i.e. A => N) and returns the string.  All spaces are accounted for and returned at the correct index. 

This exercise was based off of freeCodeCamp's "Caesars Cipher" exercise in the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects section.
